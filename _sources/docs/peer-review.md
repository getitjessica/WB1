# Peer Reviewing a _Data Good_

Welcome to the peer review process on GitHub! Peer review is a crucial step in collaborative development, ensuring code quality, correctness, and adherence to project standards. This guide outlines the steps to perform an effective peer review on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Account:** Ensure you have a GitHub account. If not, [join now](https://github.com/join).

- **Access to Repository:** Obtain access to the repository you'll be reviewing. If it's a public repository, you can directly contribute. For private repositories, request access from the repository owner.

## Peer Review Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
cd repository
```

### 2. Create a New Branch

```shell
git checkout -b feature/peer-review
```

### 3. Review Code Changes

- **Files Changed**: Identify the files modified by the pull request.

- **Read Code**: Understand the proposed changes. Look for clarity, adherence to coding standards, and logical structure.

### 4. Test the Changes

- **Local Testing**: If possible, test the changes locally to ensure they work as intended.

- **Review Tests**: Check if the changes include new tests or update existing ones.

### 5. Provide Constructive Feedback

- **Comments**: Use inline comments on specific lines of code to provide feedback.

- **General Comments**: Add general comments summarizing your review at the end of the pull request.

### 6. Verify Documentation

- **Update Docs**: Ensure that documentation is updated to reflect the changes.

- **Accuracy**: Check if the documentation accurately describes the new features or changes.

### 7. Check for Code Style

- **Consistency**: Verify that the code follows the established coding style guide.

- **Naming Conventions**: Check if variable and function names are clear and follow conventions.

### 8. Security and Performance

- **Security**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities and suggest improvements.

- **Performance**: Consider the impact on performance and suggest optimizations if necessary.

### 9. Submit Your Review

- **Review Summary**: Provide a summary of your review in the GitHub interface.

### 10. Follow Up

- **Discussion**: Engage in any discussion arising from your comments.

- **Re-review**: If changes are requested, re-review the modified code.
